# generatedata.com v4 documentation

This site is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents
hosting service.

### Deployment

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push
to the `gh-pages` branch.
