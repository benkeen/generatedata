## `@generatedata/i18n-core`

This package contains the code translations for the core script.

This is imported by the main `@generatedata/i18n` package, which houses the complete translations: core and plugins.

### Commands

`build` - this actually doesn't build anything, but validates the localization files and throws and error when there
are problems. This ensures the package is always in a valid state for building the monorepo
