# [Docs](../../../docs/README.md) &raquo; Plugins

The generatedata script is an _engine_ to let you generate different sorts of data. It can be extended via plugins
to let you generate precisely whatever data you want, in whatever format you want.

This folder contains the three types of plugins available. A lot of the documentation in this section is to explain how
to configure the plugins for use by the CLI, and what options are available for each. For normal use, you'd see all this
information via the generatedata UI.

- [Data Types](./dataTypes/README.md) - types of data that can be generated (e.g. names, phone numbers, email addresses)
- [Export Types](./exportTypes/README.md) - the format of the generate data (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML, SQL)
- [Countries](./countries/README.md) - country-specific data to improve how realistic the regional data looks
