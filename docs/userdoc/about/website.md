# The website

The [generatedata.com](https://generatedata.com) public site has been around since 2005 to provide an online version of 
the open source script. To cover hosting costs, we added an option for people to register for a user account 
on the site. This lets them save their data sets.

Virtually all the the same functionality has always been available on the open source version - you just need to download
and install the script yourself. 

Over time we plan to continue expanding the website's functionality beyond the open source version, namely to target it 
more towards businesses and offer different ways to group and share data sets.
