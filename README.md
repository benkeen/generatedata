Sometimes you need fake data for things like testing software, populating databases and creating 
realistic-looking mockups. For text, we have lorem ipsum; but for everything else...? This tool was 
written to provide a quick and simple way to let you generate large volumes of custom data in 
whatever format you require. 

## Demo
### Version 1.0.0 
There's a free online version found on our website:
http://www.generatedata.com/#generator

The online demo is actually running a very old version of the code, no longer available.

### Version 2.x
Version 2 was never fully completed. A proof of concept was gotten up and running back in 2010, which 
added (basic) modularity and improved a few things, but I abandoned it in favour of some other projects
I was working on at the time.

### Version 3.0.0 alpha
http://alpha.generatedata.com

Currently the 3.0.0 branch is in alpha phase, meaning it's not production ready - lots of bugs to squash!
However, that's the version I'd suggest downloading and using. I'm working on this version currently 
(Jan 2013) and hope to get it into Beta / final release fairly soon.

Please be warned: the trunk of the code is in flux. The UI, functionality, code architecture and other big
stuff has all be settled, but any check-in may make the script unusable. So if you're downloading it, 
*download the latest tag*.

## Versions

* 1.0.0 - found on our [live site](http://www.generatedata.com/#generator), but now out of date.
* 2.3.9 - a refactored version of 1.0.0 offering a lot more options. This is fully functional and you
can [download it via the tag](https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/tags).
* 3.0.0 - _currently under development_. This version is a complete re-write of 2.3.9.

## Installation

For (rather scanty) installation instructions of version 1 and 2 of the scripts, please see:
http://www.generatedata.com/#download

Version 3 has a built-in installation script. Much, much more documentation coming soon... first thing's
first: finish 3.0.0!
