# User documentation

Welcome to the generatedata.com user documentation! The purpose of this section is to explain what the application does, 
how to install it, and provide a little history on the script.

Note that the production website for this script ([generatedata.com](https://generatedata.com)) is a private
fork of this repo. They're very similar, but the public site contains a few additions that you won't see in this script,
such as the payment registration options. See the [website doc](./about/website.md) page for more info on that.

### Tips and Links

- For info on how to *use* the application, see the in-app help. In the footer there's a "Take a tour" option to give
you a good overview of the application as a whole. Also, after selecting a Data Type, click the help icon next on the row
to learn more about what it offers. You'll be able to browse the full doc for all Data Types there.
- For day-to-day updates on what's going on with the script, see the [github issues](https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/issues)
section.
- For the list of what's changed, see the [changelog](https://github.com/benkeen/generatedata/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
- For developers interested in the technical aspects of the script, like how to write plugins, 
see the [developer documentation](./developerdoc/intro).
