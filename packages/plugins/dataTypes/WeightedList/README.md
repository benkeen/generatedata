# [Docs](../../../../../docs/README.md) &raquo; [Plugins](../../README.md) &raquo; [Data Types](../README.md) &raquo; WeightedList

This Data Type generates random item or items from a weighted list. A weighted list is just a list of items where each
item has a certain probability of occurring, for example:

```
A: 5
B: 10
C: 5
```

In this instance, we have three list items: A, B and C, and the number next to them represent their weight. So B is 
twice as likely to appear in the results as either A or C.
