Then, once you've whet your appetite, there's a free, fully functional, GNU-licensed version available for download. Alternatively, if you want to avoid the hassle of setting it up on your own server, you can donate $20 or more to get an account on this site, letting you generate up to 5,000 records at a time (instead of the maximum 100), and let you save your data sets.

For people interested in generating more accurate localized geographical data, they can add new Country plugins that supply region names (states, provinces, territories etc), city names and postal/zip code formats for their country of choice.
