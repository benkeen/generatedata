  "emailHelp2": "Here you have two options: Random Strings or Fields. This setting controls the source material for the local part - the part that appears before the \"@\" character in the email address. The default Random Strings option uses lorem ipsum words (placeholder text) as the source material, whereas the Fields option lets you target other Name fields in your data set. This allows you to generate email addresses that look more realistic.",
