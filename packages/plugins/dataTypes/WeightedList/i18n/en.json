  "helpIntro": "The <b>Weighted List</b> Data Type generates randomly chosen item or items from a custom-defined list, factoring in whatever weight you want to apply to each item. The weight field lets you change the probability of each item appearing so you can create more realistic-looking data. For example, say you wanted to generate a list of professions, but wanted 'Brain surgeon' and 'Astronaut' to appear very infrequently because they're not common. For that, you could just bump up the weights of the others:",
