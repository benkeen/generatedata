# generatedata.com

This is the repo for the downloadable version of [generatedata.com](https://generatedata.com). The script is essentially
an _engine_ to generate any sort of random data in any format. It currently comes with 30 or
so _Data Types_ (types of data it generates), 12 _Export Types_ (formats for the data, like CSV, SQL, JSON), plus
around 32 data sets for specific countries (city names, regions etc). But more importantly it can be extended in any
way you want. Check out the [developer documentation](https://benkeen.github.io/generatedata/developerdoc/intro/) for more
information on that.

### Programmatic generation

The current major version of the script is 4.x, which was a big change over earlier releases. Earlier versions were written
in PHP and MYSQL and 3.x offered a REST API to let you generate the data programmatically rather than via an API. While this is
still planned for 4.x it's not currently offered, and the plan it to tackle that _after_ making the script available
as an npm package - which we feel will be a more convenient way to programmatically generate data over the more agnostic
REST approach.
